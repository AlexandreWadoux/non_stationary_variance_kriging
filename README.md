# Kriging with external drift and non-stationary variance 
Sample codes for our paper [ Sampling design optimisation for rainfall prediction using a non-stationary geostatistical model](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309170817300830) and Accounting for non-stationary variance in geostatistical mapping of soil properties (submitted).

Here is a brief introduction on the utilities for each script.

- **"/1 Load the likelihood"** You must save and download the likelihood.R script. This is then loaded in the main.R script.

- **"/2 Run main.R"** You can run main.R after installing the necessary packages.
