# Kriging with external drift and non-stationary variance 
Sample codes for our paper [ Sampling design optimisation for rainfall prediction using a non-stationary geostatistical model](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309170817300830) and [Accounting for non-stationary variance in geostatistical mapping of soil properties](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706117319730).

Here is a brief introduction on the utilities for each script.

- **/1 Install the variography package** You can download variography.zip and install it through R. (not yet available on CRAN, upon request)

- **/2 Load the likelihood** You must download and save the likelihood.R script. This is then loaded in the main.R script.

- **/3 Run main.R** You can run main.R after installing the necessary packages.
